# Introduction
Hello, my name is Marcin and I have prepared two short demos using JS/TS and a PIXI.js library.
# Demo #2 (Typescript + PIXI.js)
This is a short demo of a reusable slot component using Typescript, PIXI.JS & Vite.
Things that can be adjusted or set as parameters are: sizes, times, speeds, images and easings.
Result of a spin is retrieved from an external API that provides a random number.
